# Exploratory Loan Data Analysis & Data Cleaning using Python & SQL


In this project, I perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on loan payments data using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to uncover trends, repayment behaviors, and risk factors. The project consists of multiple steps, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

## Key activities in the Project:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on loan payments data using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to identify trends, repayment behaviors, and potential risk factors.  
2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning** using **Python (Pandas)** and **SQL** to prepare the raw dataset for analysis.  
3. Cleaned the raw loan data with a **Python script** in Jupyter Notebook, addressing missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality 
4. Applied **SQL scripting** to further clean and transform the loan payment data.  
5. Updated the cleaned dataset using **Pandas** and visualized key patterns in loan repayment and approval processes.  

## Tools:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Seaborn**
- **Matplotlib**
